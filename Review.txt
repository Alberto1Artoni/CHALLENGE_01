In the README.md I would have expected something a bit more clear.
  - Use sections to divide several information:
      - what your code is about
      - how to compile your code
      - how to run some tests

This README.md could be improved.

There are no comments in the whole code... The code is quite readable and kinda self-explaining, but comments where required.

Why is the <random> library included? Careful in copy-pasting the code :)
